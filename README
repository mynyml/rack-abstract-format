SUMMARY

Strips the extension from the requested path (env['PATH_INFO']) and stores it
into env['request.format']. This allows dealing with path information
separately from format information, which are often different concerns.

This is especially useful when dealing with routes as it allows a resource to
always point to the same action independently from the requested format.

USAGE

use Rack::AbstractFormat
run app

The request:

  GET /path/resource.xml

will become:

  GET /path/resource
  env['request.format'] #=> 'xml'

TIP

To make sure there is always an extension, as well as to retrieve format
information from the request's Accept header, use together with rack-contrib's
Rack::AcceptFormat middleware.
